# Cypherflow

Cypherflow is an execution engine that incorporates dataflow concepts using the Cypher Query Language.

Execution results are cached in a property graph for future querying. Should no results return for a given subgraph, an appropriately formed one will serve as a declarative expression for reification through tasking in a dataflow-like manner.

## Implementation Details

- Results are cached in Experience and Submission graph databases.
- Services using Cypherflow need to implement: Expression Parsers and Tasks.

### Databases

- The Experience DB contains the consolidated experience of all computed task outputs.
- The Submissions DB can be used to track submissions history and task statuses within a submission.

### Expression Parsers

- An expression parser translates a string-based expression into a Cypher query for engine submission.
- This removes the need for end-users to write Cypher and allows for multiple ways to express a submission.

### Tasks

- A task is a lifecycle-based conditional execution unit that could reify parts of a graph.
- Each task defines a specification for its inputs and output, as well as a compute function.
- Tasks can indirectly react to the completion of other tasks (Ã  la dataflow).

#### Specification

- Array of inputs each defined by a pattern path pointing to the output node (each element must be named). 
- One output node.

#### Compute Function

- TBD.
